We chose the commonsense segmentation method because it required less capital, faster, and less complexity.

We will mainly focus on the details of how to identify the ideal target audience and how to select variables for the data collection process.

#### Specifying the ideal target segment
1. **Knock-out criteria** are considered a "Must have" characteristic and those elements need to show up in the selected customer groups. An important criteria are as follows:
####
| Criteria | Description     | 
| :-------- | :------- | 
| homogeneous | Share similar characteristics within the group. | 
| distinct | Group must be clearly different from other groups. | 
| Large enough | Groups are have enough members | 
| Matching | Selected group is consistent with the organization's competitive strengths. | 
| Identifiable | Customer does really exist. | 
| Reachable | Can reach customers. | 

2. **Attractiveness criteria** considered a "Should have" characteristic and used to measure the attractiveness of each group. Scores will be given based on how interesting the group is.
###
#### Variables for the data collection process
This step requires defining the variables for use in the data collection process. There are two types of variables that must be created as follows:

1. Segmentation variables are used to divide different groups in the sample data from each other.
2. Descriptor variables are used to describe the characteristics of the sample and are not used for grouping.
####
Those criteria can be divided into various topics as follows:
1. Geographic segmentation
2. Socio-demographic segmentation
3. Psychographic segmentation
4. Behavioral segmentation
